# TerminalSnakeGame
A classic snake game make in C++ which is playable in a PowerShell or terminal window, diplayed using ASCII characters.

This repository contains a simple Snake game created for educational purposes. 

## How to Play

The game is simple to play. Use the asdw keys to move the snake around the screen.
Key:  a = left     w = up     d = right     s = down    (x = exit the game)
The goal of the game is to eat as many apples as possible without running into the walls or the snake's tail. Each apple that you eat will increase your score by ten and the snake's size by one length.

Options: 
- The game's default is Easy Mode: If you hit the wall you come out the opposite wall
- Otherwise uncomment the Classic Mode for harder gameplay: You die if you hit the wall

In both modes, hitting your tail or doubling back on yourself will end the game.
